# Assignment3
In this assignment, we were asked to reproduce and extend the work conducted in the "Tensor House" labs, specifically the following Jupyter Notebooks:

Visual Search Artistic Style: This code's major purpose is to construct a system that can search for and retrieve photographs based on their artistic styles. Unlike traditional image retrieval systems that emphasize text or tags, this code focuses on the visual artistic style of photographs. The code demonstrates how deep learning and image analysis techniques may be used to create an image search system with an emphasis on artistic flair, providing a novel approach to explore and find visual material.

Visual Search Similarity: The major purpose of this code is to construct an image retrieval system that identifies and displays images that are visually similar to a given query image. Unlike standard image search systems that depend on written descriptions or tags, this method detects similarities between photos based on their visual characteristics.It is helpful for activities like reverse image search, in which users supply a picture and wish to identify comparable ones.

Visual Search Variational Autoencoders: The code is largely concerned with the implementation of a visual search system utilising a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This code demonstrates how to create a visual search system using a VAE. Based on learning embeddings, it allows users to locate photos with comparable visual qualities. This sort of system may be used in recommendation systems, image retrieval, and other areas.

The goal is to recreate the experiments, train the models, and extend these findings in a streamlined manner. Each of these Notebooks introduces and explores different facets of visual search using deep learning techniques, covering topics like artistic style transfer, similarity search, and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

Additionally, we will take the further step of deploying these models as Streamlit applications on the Streamlit public cloud using Code Spaces.
